Student Grades Calculator
This C++ program provides a streamlined way to enter, compute, and organize student grades. It handles homework and exam scores dynamically using modern object‑oriented design, including a full implementation of the Rule of Three. Users can calculate final grades using either the average or the median of homework results, import data from external files, or generate scores automatically. The application produces neatly formatted tables sorted by name or surname, making it suitable for both small and large student datasets. The codebase follows C++ best practices and is designed to be clear, modular, and easy to expand.
